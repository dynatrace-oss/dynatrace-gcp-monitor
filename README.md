# Dynatrace integration for Google Cloud Platform monitoring

This is the home of `dynatrace-gcp-function` which provides the mechanism to pull all [Google Cloud metrics](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp) and  [Cloud logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs)  into Dynatrace. 

This integration consists of K8s container and few auxiliary components. This setup will be running in your GCP project and will be pushing data to Dynatrace. We provide bash script that will deploy all necessary elements.

**To deploy this integration**, see the docs on how to [run it on Google Kubernetes Engine](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/deploy-k8).

## (legacy info) Cloud Function deployment is deprecated

Up till now, there was an option to deploy GCP integration as Cloud Function (instead of K8s container). It is now deprecated and will only be supported till the end of March 2023. If you are using this kind of deployment, you should switch to K8s container as soon as possible.

See [migration guide](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/migrate-gcp-function-1-to-k8s-1).
