# Dynatrace integration for Google Cloud Platform monitoring

This is the home of `dynatrace-gcp-function` which provides the mechanism to pull all [Google Cloud metrics](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp) into Dynatrace. 
 
To help with deployment you can use automation scripts available in this repo.

Maintaining its lifecycle places a burden on the operational team.


## Getting started
There are two deployment options available, you can:
- [run it on Google Kubernetes Engine](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/deploy-k8) or 
- [deploy a Google Cloud Function](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/deploy-gcp)


## Pricing
Ingested metrics will consume DDUs. For more details [refer to documention](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/reference/monitoring-consumption-calculation/#expand-gcp-service-monitoring-consumption-104)
